After creating a repository in aws, create permission for that repo.
- Permission on the left.
- Edit
- Add statement.
- Select all entities.
  - if there's no familiar entity, goes to IAM, create UserGroup --> create User and give that UserGroup the AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess, AmazonElasticContainerRegistryPublicFullAccess (there are 5 ContainerRegistry related, if not sure add them all)
- Then if performs as the the guide.
- If the terminal returns "you missed this permission", then go to the Permission screen --> edit policy JSON --> add that permission.
